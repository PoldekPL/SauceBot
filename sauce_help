*For general information regarding SauceBot, send `sauce.info`.*

**The command prefix for the bot is `sauce.`, shorthand `s.`** If you have a problem seeing bot's replies to your commands, make sure you have enabled **Link Preview** in *User Settings* > *Text & Images*.

SauceBot can create for you links that lead to different reverse search engines. All you need to do is provide image(s) for bot to work on. **SauceBot does not work on videos, because the search engines do not work on videos.** If you want to find the source for a video, usually your best bet is making a screenshot of the first frames of it, and then performing the search on that screenshot.

Currently working methods to obtain the sauce are:
**1. Directly attached image(s)**
Attach the image(s) to the message that invokes a command. If you're on mobile, one message can have multiple attachments and they will all be processed by the bot. On desktop, you need to call the appropriate command for every image you send.
**2. Image link**
In the same message call a command and follow it with a link to an image. It should be a valid, publicly accessible link to an image, otherwise search engines will fail fetching and processing the image.
**3. Discord message permalink**
Just like the image link, but use the link that leads to a Discord message. Bot will detect it, fetch the message you've linked to and process the files attached to it.

SauceBot can create links to following search engines:
**• Google**
Command: `sauce.google`, `sauce.g`
You know Google, I know Google, almost every human on Earth knows Google. Very good results when searching for IRL stuff and generally "western" art. Image recognition and suggested search keywords range from surprisingly specific to comically bad.
**• SauceNAO**
Command: `sauce.saucenao`, `sauce.sauce`, `sauce.s`
Yes, that's why the bot is called *Sauce*Bot. Specializes in various imageboards and some art sites.
**• TinEye**
Command: `sauce.tineye`, `sauce.t`
TinEye's gimmick is figuring out if what you want to search has been cropped or rotated from an original picture. Other than that, result base is similar to Google.
**• IQDB**
Command: `sauce.iqdb`, `sauce.i`
IQDB is similar to SauceNAO, but much more anime-centric.
**• Yandex**
Command: `sauce.yandex`, `sauce.y`
Yandex is somewhat of a Russian Google. Often when Google fails, Yandex knows exactly what you're looking for. Image recognition is absolutely impeccable, to the point of being creepily accurate is suggesting similar images.

To use all of them at once, use the command `sauce.all` (or `sauce.a`).
