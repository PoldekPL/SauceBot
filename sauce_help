There are multiple ways to use SauceBot:

**1. Attach a file.**
To find sauce for a single file, attach it to a message saying `!sauce`. If you're on mobile, it is possible to send a message with multiple files attached, and they all will be sauced. On desktop, every file is a separate message, so you need to remember to type `!sauce` for each of them. Alternatively, check method **2.**
**2. Batch mode.**
For when you got a lot of picture you want to find the sources for, there is batch mode. Use `!batch` (shorthand `!b`) - it'll let you configure it - then just post pictures - for each message with picture you send, bot will return links that may lead to source. To end batch mode, use `!batch` again. Remember that it only works for pictures you send, not links.
**3. Discord message permalink.**
If you've got Developer Mode enabled (which is a good, non-intrusive thing to have enabled in general), every message will have in the little menu on the right an option to copy permalink to it. By sending a message saying `!sauce [message permalink]`, the linked message will be fetched and analyzed and all files attached to it will be sauced.
**4. Picture permalink**
Lastly, you can just use any link that leads to a picture, by typing `!sauce [link]`. As SauceBot will just attach the link you gave it to different search service links, it's your job to make sure that it's a valid picture link.

The shorthand for `!sauce` command is `!s`.
